Master-Slave Authoritative-Only DNS setup


## In progress...

This will be some kind of tool or a puppet manifest which will deploy EC2 machines on Amazon Web Services (AWS), probably in a common subnet (or may be I can provide that as an option; I can always later set them as environment variables to simply plug them), and use the NSD DNS server package/software to setup authoritative-only DNS servers in a master-slave setup. It might initially just support 2 machines to be used as dns servers, however, I intend to make it more flexible (I guess it might be one more environment variable!).

Some supporting files that I will actually use will be present.
